# password-generator

Generates random passwords with toggling between uppercase & lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. (HTML, CSS, JS)

Previous Version
Generates random password with following specific pattern scheme, first a upper character (A-Z) then, lower letter (a-z) then, number (0-9), then a symbol (!@#$%^&*()[]{}<>`~;:,.?/)
ULNS (U is for upper, L is for Lower, N is for number, S is for symbols)
and repeats this pattern for required number of password length and if required length is not a multiple of 4 it slices the password for given length.

Version 2
As previously generated password were following a pattern (ULNS), therefore we receive the generated password and before returning the password all the elements (letters) of password are swapped with other random elements.
